    <summary id = "ugstudies">My Undergraduate Studies</summary>
    <p>I am currently studying at the National University of Singapore, as a second year Civil Engineering undergraduate student. Through my studies, I have gained useful industry knowledge, as well as practical engineering skills. </p>
    <p>Additionally, the expansive curriculum provided me with skills not only in the domain of civil engineering, but also in other fields. The plethora of group projects helped develop my soft skills and other useful related skills that can be applied to the industry.</p>
  </details>
  <details open>
    <summary id = "workexp">Work experience</summary>
    <p>I am currently working in the music industry, where I spend my time curating detailed curriculum for my students to enhance their learning and develop their interests, critical thinking and emotional development. I adopt widely versatile teaching methods, catering to each students' interest and ability.</p>
    <p>Prior to that, I worked in HR for 2 years handling administrative matters and tracking records. Working with a diverse set of characters and catering to their needs definitely helped me develop a skillset that is very applicable to my current and future jobs.</p>
    <p>I have also worked several short term jobs in the sales, customer service, and private education industries.</p>

    <summary id = "volunteer">Community Involvement and Volunteering</summary>
    <p>Beyond work and academics, I have always been interested in giving back to the community and helping the less fortunate. I had a 2 year stint with Rotaract during my JC years, and completed and planned many volunteering events.</p>
    <p>I have also volunteered with several organisations, working with people of different needs and demographics.</p>
    <p>These volunteering opportunities have provided me with an opportunity to interact with people of various backgrounds, and being able to work with people of differing personalities is a crucial skillset that I can apply regardless of the situation.</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary id = "pasttimes">Hobbies</summary>
    <p>I am also heavily invested in playing music, specifically the piano. It is an enriching endeavour for me, as I get to create music and see my practice come to fruition. I am currently in preparation for AmusTCL in piano performance.</p>
    <p>I spend the remaining of my time on non-competitive sports and picking up new skills. It has always enjoyable to learn new things and pick up new skills, irregardless of the relevance to my work.</p>
